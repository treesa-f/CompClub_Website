  This year we will be providing 3 workshops in an online format instead of in person! We will have a series of videos covering the three workshops on: 
  - Game Development
  - Cyber Security
  - Web Development
 
There will also be a livestream covering an introduction to Python during the holidays (date TBD), where students can take part and ask questions in real time! We will be releasing the workshop videos on a schedule, starting on Monday 6th July. 

There is no registration needed and is open to all high school students of any ability.  We will be releasing the virtual workshop site closer to the Winter School Holidays, and will update the link here once it is ready!
