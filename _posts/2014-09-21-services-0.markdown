  This year we will be providing 3 free workshops in an online format instead of in person! We will have a series of videos covering three workshops: 
  - Game Development (HTML/CSS)
  - Cyber Security
  - Web Development (Javascript)
 
There will also be a livestream covering an introduction to Python during the holidays, where students can take part and ask questions in real time! We will be releasing the workshop videos on a schedule, starting on Monday 6th July. 

There is no cost or registration needed and is open to all high school students of any ability.  We will be releasing all our virtual workshops on our new site: [https://compclub.csesoc.unsw.edu.au](https://compclub.csesoc.unsw.edu.au) 

Simply make an account and you will be able to access the workshops once released!
